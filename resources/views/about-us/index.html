                <p class="foundation-info" style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem;">Deepak Foundation was initiated in 1982 with a vision of providing healthcare facilities to the families of workers and local communities residing in the industrial area of Nandesari. The Foundation has progressed over the period into a leading non-profit civil society. With a Pan-India presence, it has branch offices in Pune, Roha, Palghar and Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Hyderabad in Telengana, Dumri, Arki, Kuchai and Madhuban in Jharkhand, and New Delhi.
                    Creating a socially inclusive and sustainable environment among the underprivileged communities by providing services in the area of healthcare, education, skills building & livelihood, and disability & special needs. We envisage a world free of distress, disease, deprivation, exploitation and subjugation, ensuring the overall well-being of the family, society and community. The overall goal of Foundation is to empower women by providing healthcare and livelihood opportunities in order to improve maternal and child health, reduce poverty and build capacity in the areas of public health and livelihood promotion, and provide an inclusive environment for children with special needs.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">In today’s world, non-communicable diseases like cancer, dementia, renal failure, etc., are increasing in leaps and bounds. They need long-term care for their chronic condition. It has been estimated that around 1.5 billion people experience chronic pain around the world, and an estimated 61 million people endure unrelieved serious health-related suffering globally. Many of them result in increasing morbidity, making patients critically ill. Death is inevitable, but today’s era is giving more importance to the quality of life lived than its longevity.</p>

                                <p>In general, palliative care mostly functions in hospitals where the patient is admitted or may be on a daycare basis, where the patient needs to pay a visit to the hospital regularly for some procedures or sessions that help in alleviating their pain and other symptoms. Palliative care should be an admixture with the curative form of treatment, which should begin from the early part of patient management. The patient, especially in their end stage of life, is happy to be with their near and dear ones, in their known home environment.</p>
                                <p>Here comes the role of palliative care, which helps improve the quality of one’s life, especially in their last days, and tries to decrease the burden of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined Palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families experiencing problems related to life-threatening diseases. It is provided through the prevention, assessment, and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems.</p>
